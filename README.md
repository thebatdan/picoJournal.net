# picoJournal.net
A tiny journal for people short on time

This project contains the picoJournal .net solution, which includes a web API. The API is based on ASP.net Core and Entity Framework, on top of an MS SQL express database.

There is a Delphi client at https://github.com/thebatdan/picoJournal.Application.Delphi that can consume the web API.

Web API usage examples can be found at https://www.getpostman.com/collections/3c03640141be6e6e60f6
